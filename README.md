# GroupProject2


**Description of project:**
This project is for a group of people in New Orleans(community group, neighborhood association, condo association, etc.) where the members all know each other and have each other’s contact information. The typical user would be a member of the group, living in an apartment or condo or house, who needs a task performed and is looking for someone to perform that task (or referrals to someone who can perform the task).

Individuals enter their name and a request to the board. Others see the request and can post a response. When the response is fulfilled, the request can be deleted from the board.
